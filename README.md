# Focus on the User for Safari

By [Florian Eckerstorfer](http://theroadtojoy.at)

Extension for Safari to replace Google+ Profiles in Google search results with the most relevant social profiles

This Safari Extension is based on the bookmarklet by [focusontheuser.org](http://focusontheuser.org). It is just a wrapper for their code and the original developers receive all credit.
